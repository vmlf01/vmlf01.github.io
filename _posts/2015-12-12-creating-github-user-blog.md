Finally decided to start a code blog. After a quick search, decided to use GitHub and Jekyll to create it.

Should have headed straight to the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) website to find out how to set it up, but instead started with a good old Google search.

The hardest part was to find out what people meant with creating a personal repository instead of a project repository. Spent some 5-10 minutes around GitHub options searching high and low for an option to create it.

Turns out you just need to create a new repository named *username.github.io* and you're all set. GitHub Pages already provides integration with Jekyll, so you just need to push your updates to *master* and your site gets updated.
